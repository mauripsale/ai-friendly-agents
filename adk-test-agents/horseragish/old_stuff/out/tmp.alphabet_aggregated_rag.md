About Non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we 
use the following non-GAAP financial measures: free cash flow; constant currency revenues; and percentage change 
in constant currency revenues. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in 
isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with 
GAAP.
We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate 
period-to-period comparisons. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental 
information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our 
recurring core business operating results, such as our revenues excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate 
movements and hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated level. We believe that both management 
and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when 
planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management’s 
internal comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity as well as comparisons to our competitors’ operating 
results. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater 
transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) 
they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business.
There are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP financial measures. We compensate for these 
limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial 
measures and evaluating these non-GAAP financial measures together with their relevant financial measures in 
accordance with GAAP.
For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the sections captioned “Reconciliation from 
GAAP Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities to Non-GAAP Free Cash Flow”and “Reconciliation from GAAP 
Revenues to Non-GAAP Constant Currency Revenues and GAAP Percentage Change in Revenues to Non-GAAP 
Percentage Change in Constant Currency Revenues” included at the end of this release.

We report our segment results as Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets:
•
Google Services includes products and services such as ads, Android, Chrome, devices, Google Maps, 
Google Play, Search, and YouTube. Google Services generates revenues primarily from advertising; fees 
received for consumer subscription-based products such as YouTube TV, YouTube Music and Premium, 
and NFL Sunday Ticket, as well as Google One; the sale of apps and in-app purchases; and devices.
•
Google Cloud includes infrastructure and platform services, applications, and other services for enterprise 
customers. Google Cloud generates revenues primarily from consumption-based fees and subscriptions 
received for Google Cloud Platform services, Google Workspace communication and collaboration tools, 
and other enterprise services.
•
Other Bets is a combination of multiple operating segments that are not individually material. Revenues 
from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of healthcare-related services and internet services.
Certain costs are not allocated to our segments because they represent Alphabet-level activities. These costs 
primarily include certain AI-focused shared R&D activities, including development costs of our general AI models; 
corporate initiatives such as our philanthropic activities; corporate shared costs such as certain finance, human 
resource, and legal costs, including certain fines and settlements. Charges associated with employee severance 
and office space reductions are also not allocated to our segments. Additionally, hedging gains (losses) related to 
revenue are not allocated to our segments.

Includes all gains and losses, unrealized and realized, on equity securities. For Q1 2025, the net effect of the gain on equity 
securities of $9.8 billion and the performance fees related to certain investments of $40 million increased the provision for 
income tax, net income, and diluted net income per share by $2.0 billion, $7.7 billion, and $0.62, respectively. Fluctuations 
in the value of our investments may be affected by market dynamics and other factors and could significantly contribute to 
the volatility of OI&E in future periods.
Reconciliation from GAAP Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities to Non-GAAP Free Cash Flow (in 
millions; unaudited):
We provide non-GAAP free cash flow for the current quarter and trailing twelve months (“TTM”) because it is a 
liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash 
generated by the business that can be used for strategic opportunities, including investing in our business and 
acquisitions, and to strengthen our balance sheet.

Reconciliation from GAAP Revenues to Non-GAAP Constant Currency Revenues and GAAP Percentage 
Change in Revenues to Non-GAAP Percentage Change in Constant Currency Revenues (in millions, except 
percentages; unaudited):
We provide non-GAAP constant currency revenues (“constant currency revenues”) and non-GAAP percentage change 
in constant currency revenues (“percentage change in constant currency revenues”), because they facilitate the 
comparison of current results to historic performance by excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate movements (“FX 
Effect”) as well as hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated level, as they are not indicative of our 
core operating results.
Non-GAAP constant currency revenues is defined as revenues excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate 
movements and hedging activities and is calculated by translating current period revenues using prior period exchange 
rates and excluding any hedging effect recognized in the current period. We calculate the percentage change in 
constant currency revenues by comparing constant currency revenues to the prior year comparable period revenues, 
excluding any hedging effect recognized in the prior period.

Q1 2025 Earnings
Reconciliation from GAAP Net Cash Provided by Operating 
Activities to Non-GAAP Free Cash Flow
We provide non-GAAP free cash flow for the current quarter and trailing twelve months (“TTM”) because it is a liquidity measure that 
provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that can be used for 
strategic opportunities, including investing in our business and acquisitions, and to strengthen our balance sheet.
●
Free cash flow: We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures.
●
TTM free cash flow: We define trailing twelve months free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital 
expenditures for the most recent twelve consecutive months.
