## Prompt

I am a long time GCP user. I have hundreds of project ids. Can you help me craft a simple script (in your favorite language: can be bash with gcloud or python/ruby with client libraries! you pick) that does the following:

Enumerate all project ids (where i have sufficient IAM privileges) with at least ONE cloud run endpoint and prints out a big JSON/YAML file with something like:

```yaml
# example
project1: insufficient permissions
project2:
- my-endpoint1 # region: us-central1
- my-endpoint2 # region: europe-west1
project3:
...
```

Now I know my example is YAML with region being unstructured but whatever format you choose SHOULD be structured so i can build on top of that output.yaml/output.json. :)

## p2

Fantastic it works! Now that i have this big JSON, can you give me a small script which uses ruby or bash/jq - your choice to take this input:

```
{
  "carlessian-gyruss": {
    "error": "Insufficient permissions (run.services.list likely missing)"
  },
  "zurigram": {
    "error": "Insufficient permissions (run.services.list likely missing)"
  },
  "legoey-2d-carlessian-tetris": {
    "error": "Insufficient permissions (run.services.list likely missing)"
  },
  "gugley-3d-tetris": {
    "error": "Insufficient permissions (run.services.list likely missing)"
  },
  "smurfs-and-dragons": {
    "error": "Insufficient permissions (run.services.list likely missing)"
  },
  "adroit-bit-nbt2m": {
    "error": "Insufficient permissions (run.services.list likely missing)"
  },
  "amsterdam-demo-tmp-crun2049": [
    {
      "name": "http-cloudrunner",
      "region": "us-central1"
    },
    {
      "name": "http-cloudrunner-py",
      "region": "us-central1"
    },
    {
      "name": "http-cloudrunner-py2",
      "region": "us-central1"
    },
    {
      "name": "http-runner-py3",
      "region": "us-central1"
    },
    {
      "name": "pubsub-sinker",
      "region": "us-central1"
    }
  ],
...
}

and then give me a 4 column table with : project_id, cloud_run_service,and possibly a dev console url to that CRun service (so the region goes in the url, I dont need to also see it as 4th field)?
