When you generate code, do not provide diffs, or single files. Always provide the full code. If the code is multifile, I prefer a file called "sbrodola.sh" bash file which generates all the single files on the initial prompt. After your initial answer with sbrodola file, with subsequent edits and new features, DO NOT give me a new sbrodola.sh, rather give me the single file changes after the many files are created: no diff, just the minimal chunk I can cut and paste into file XYZ to get the change done; for instance, if 5 functions change -> give me the whole file, if 1 function/line changes => give me the function code; if EVERY file changes -> give me a new sbrodola.sh
I prefer multiple smaller files to a single one, and I tend to put all files under lib/ , separated by functionality (network, genai, utils, colors).
I always like to have a color.py/color.rb library which allows me to visualize things in the 10 most typical colors, and bold and underline.
I'd like to keep the main.py / main.rb as small and succinct as possible, and just to have FLAGS in there (--help, --debug and so on).
Use strong typing when you get to choose (eg using strong-typed and named args in Python and ruby3 whenever possible). In general, choose an implementation that generates compile error vs runtime error for ease of troubleshooting and testing.
I like explicit versioning a lot, since code is AI-generated. Iâ€™d like all my projects to have a VERSION file which contains the version, and a CHANGELOG.md containing a markdown with version changes. When main.py/main.rb change. Please bump the version number.
