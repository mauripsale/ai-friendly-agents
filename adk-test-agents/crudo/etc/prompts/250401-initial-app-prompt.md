I want to create an application in Python which is able to use
`google-genai` capabilities to assess my Cloud Run app on GCP in current PROJECT_ID,
provided via `.env`.

I want to use function calling to provide the following Cloud run functionality:

1. Get all Cloud Run endpoints for a project (input: project_id(STRING)). Endpoint  should be a FQDN containing also project_id
2. Get all Cloud Run Versions for a Run endpoint (input: endpoint_fqdn(STRING))
3. Get all Logs for a Run version (input: endpoint_fqdn(STRING)). Output should also be a run_version_fqdn containing project and endpoint name in it.
4. Get YAML configuration for a single Run version (contains all important metadata like: date of launch, principal which launched it, ENV configuration, and so on.)
   Again, input: endpoint_fqdn
5. Get logs for a single run endpoint+version.

Since API calls take time, particularly for logs, all data should be cached locally and deterministically in form of files, in an intelligently nested way, for instance:

Caching file system sample:

* .cache/<PROJECT_ID>/cloud-run/endpoints.json
* .cache/<PROJECT_ID>/cloud-run/<ENDPOINT_NAME>/versions.json
* .cache/<PROJECT_ID>/cloud-run/<ENDPOINT_NAME>/<VERSION_NAME>/config.yaml
* .cache/<PROJECT_ID>/cloud-run/<ENDPOINT_NAME>/<VERSION_NAME>/YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-logs.txt

Function call should check for cache hit, with obsolescence of 1 hour.
Function calls will have an optional `ignore_cache: False` by default. If true, they will bypass cache,
for instance when super-fresh logs need to be checked.

Please write the skeleton code, providing this:

* .env
* requirements.txt
* main.py                 # simple main with just ARGV processing.
* lib/ricc_colors.py      # contains yellow(str), green(str), .. simple functionality
* lib/ricc_cloud_run.py   # contains all Cloud Run functions
* lib/ricc_genai.py       # contains all Gemini genai calls.
* You can come up with additional files, under `lib/`

The main interface should be a CLI chat. A debug/verbose toggle should enable us to show debug messages
and verbose should enable/disable a STDOUT log of Gemini Function Calling.

A chat should look something like:

üßë: ‚ÄúHow are my Cloud Run endpoints doing?‚Äù
‚öíÔ∏è <fc: retrieve cloud run endpoints and last 10 revisions each>
‚ôä:: you have ‚Äúmyapp-dev‚Äù and ‚Äúmyapp-prod‚Äù, both deployed 7 minuets ago. PROD is in good standing, but dev update didn't work, so Run is still running the previous version.
üßë:User: Can you tell me what went wrong there?
‚öíÔ∏è <fc: retrieve logs for ‚Äúmyapp-dev‚Äù(N) and  ‚Äúmyapp-dev‚Äù(N-1) and also metadata YAML  for both>
‚ôä:The logs from latest version claim there is not sufficient memory. No other ENV variables have been changed that I know of. I can suppose the new docker image requires more RAM. You can try to increase the CRun RAM with this gcloud run update ‚Ä¶ command. Would you like me to do it for you? If yes, please tell me that you‚Äôre sure and the name of the app.
üßë:Yes, I‚Äôm sure, for ‚Äúmyapp-dev‚Äù.
‚öíÔ∏è <fc: updates Cloud Run with 4x RAM>
‚ôä: Done. [Since this is a low risk.]
