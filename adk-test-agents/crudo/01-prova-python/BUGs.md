## logs are too big.

one log was 700MB (!!) Let's cap a log to max N lines, or M size (say 10MB)?
Maybe we could have a different file per log and split in smaller chunks so Gemini
can ingest one each?

According to an LLM: `6.5MB` is the sweet spot.

* A million (1M) tokens in an LLM, when converted to bytes, would be approximately 6.6 million bytes, based on the average 6.6 bytes per token.
