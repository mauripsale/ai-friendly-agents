## Prompt

I have an existing python application frontend which uses a number of files in lib/
and calls main.py and has constants in constants.py.
This is a responsive chat built with Gemini which investigates a Cloud Run application.

I would like to create a streamlit application and keep it tidy done this way:

`./app.py` contains as little as possible to get started

Then I'd like to split all important stuff: UI, state, .. maybe left column in one file each:

`./lib/streamlit/state.py` contain all the UI logic
`./lib/streamlit/ui.py` contain all the UI logic
`./lib/streamlit/...` for anything else you need.

Functionality:

* The app shall have this memory configured:

   * User Id: defaults to "ENV[USER]@google.com" - if unavailable, defaults to 'ricc@google.com'
   * Gemini Model: defaults to ENV[GEMINI_MODEL] - if unavailable defaulst to 'gemini-1.5-flash'
   * Cloud Region: defaults to ENV[GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION] and defaults to "europe-west1"

1. The app should have a left column where you can store two things:

INVESTIGATIONS (chats)

   1. multiple conversations which we'll call "investigations". Each investigation is basically a new chat with Gemini
      LLM constructed. Every investigation is clickable and you can resume the conversation from where you left it (I'll
      need to persist it later, for now we can just persist to file)
   2. The investigation will visualize (and persist to a local convos.sqlite3 DB) all the conversations. This will be using
      Gemini with function_calling.
   3. If the function_calling returns a JSON with a `chart_filename` field (its a local Path() string), that Chart will be visualized directly in
      the conversation, which is the cool feature of this multimodal chat.
   4. The chat should be responsive (visualize chat chunk by chunk) - which is the main reason why I'm choosing streamlit.


PROJECT/CLOUDRUN_SERVICE chooser + and Service synoptic.

   1. First, a projectId chooser (say 'onramp'). It should probably look like a dropdown. We have a function to retrieve projects by user: `get_projects_by_user(email: str)`
   2. Within the projectId chooser, a "CloudRun Endpoint" chooser: another dropdown fetching with `get_cloud_run_endpoints(project_id: str, region: str)`
   3. Once you select this, we can visualize a number of information which is relevant to this couple. I have text and images to portray for it. For instance,
        by looking at `.cache/palladius-genai/cloud-run/gemini-news-crawler-manhouse-prod/service.yaml` you can find some interesting fields
        for project 'palladius-genai' and service 'gemini-news-crawler-manhouse-prod', like the "urls:" stanza contains an array of its public URLs.
   4. In a subfolder: `.cache/palladius-genai/cloud-run/gemini-news-crawler-manhouse-prod/mon-charts/`, you have a number of monitoring charts which I'd like to also
      show there. Finally, there should be a button like "Start an investigation for this Endpoint" which creates a new investigation (=chat) for this
      particular ProkjectId, Region, and CloudRun Service (=endpoint).

## h2


So two things:

1. too many Welcome investigation - I'd like to have some clickable part (like a X or a bomb emoji) to kill a conversation. I'm testing and already 15 "Welcome investigations" are there.

2. Do not trigger a Welcome investigation when I select project+cloud run. Instead, I would like to visualize a synoptic page on the right (main page). This page should first get the service.yaml into a dictionary, then visualize:
   * a CPU icon with a dictionary lookup Service_dict (`cat service.yaml | yq .template.containers[0].resources.limits.cpu`)
   * a RAM icon with a lookup from service.yaml  (`cat service.yaml | yq .template.containers[0].resources.limits.cpu`)
   * an Array of ENV key-values: (`cat service.yaml | yq .template.containers[0].env -> array of [name, value])
   * BaseImageURI: `cat service.yaml | yq .template.containers[0].baseImageUri`)

3. After this synoptic page, we can put a green button like: "Start an investigation" plus N yellow buttons with
   "Continue investigation $TITLE" for all conversation for this same project/service.
