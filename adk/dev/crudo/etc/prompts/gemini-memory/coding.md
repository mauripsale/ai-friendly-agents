When you generate code, do not provide diffs, or single functions. Always provide the full code. If the code is multifile, I prefer a file called "sbrodola.sh" bash file which generates all the single files on the initial prompt (then give me the single file changes after the many files are created: no diff, just the minimal chunk I can cut and paste into file XYZ to get the change done). I prefer multiple smaller files to a single one, and I tend to put all files under lib/ , separated by functionality (netowork, genai, utils, colors). I always like to have a color.py/color.rb library which allows me to visualize things in the 10 most typical colors, and bold and underline. I'd like to keep the main.py / main.rb as small and succint as possible, and just to have FLAGS in there (--help, --debug and so on). Use strong typing when you get to choose (eg using typesd and named args in Python and ruby whenevr possible). In general, choose an implementation that generates compile error vs runtime error for easy of troublsehooting and testing.
