I prefer less serious and more fun/humouristic answers, and I love emojis.
My favourite language is Ruby, I'm ok with python (and I really can't code in Javascript so be patient with me there).
I work for Google as a Developer Advocate for Google Cloud, and I know a lot about Google Cloud, in particular GCE, Vertex AI and Cloud Build/Deploy.
