# --- Processing with jq ---
# -r = raw output (strings without quotes)
#
# Logic breakdown:
# 1. to_entries[]             -> Stream each project {key: "proj_id", value: data}
# 2. select(.value | type == "array") -> Only keep projects where 'value' is an array (i.e., has services listed, not an error)
# 3. select(.value | length > 0) -> Further filter to only those with *at least one* service in the array
# 4. .key as $project_id       -> Store the project ID (key) in a variable $project_id
# 5. .value[]                 -> Iterate through each service object in the 'value' array
# 6. select(.name and .region) -> Make sure the service object actually has name and region (robustness)
# 7. .name as $service_name | .region as $region -> Store name and region in variables
# 8. Construct the output string using variables, separated by tabs (\t)
#    The URL is built using the standard Cloud Console pattern.
