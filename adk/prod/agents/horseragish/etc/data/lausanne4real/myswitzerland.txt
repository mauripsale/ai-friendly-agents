Intro
The wide embankments on Lake Geneva, the Olympic Museum, the widely diverse urban quarters and the parklands: Lausanne is full of joie de vivre. Alongside Notre Dame Cathedral, the metro is a key city landmark. Also, thanks to the hillside location, you can see the lake wherever you go.

Lausanne at a glance
This is Lausanne
Lausanne is located in the canton of Vaud in southwestern Switzerland and directly on Lake Geneva. The city’s parks, terraced vineyards and abundance of art and culture make Lausanne a popular destination.
Discover Lausanne
Start your sightseeing in Plateforme 10, the cultural quarter next to the train station. Further north, explore the lively Flon district. Next you’ll encounter the historic heart of Lausanne: Take a leisurely stroll to the Place de la Palud and via the Escaliers du Marché to Notre Dame Cathedral. Here, a tower watchman has been calling the time on the hour every night for 600 years. Switzerland’s only genuine metro will take you to Parc de Sauvabelin, where you can slow your pace in the wide green spaces or take a boat ride on the park’s idyllic lake. The Sauvabelin Tower offers views of the whole of Lausanne and Lake Geneva.
Lakeside leisure in Ouchy
Ouchy is the ideal place to experience the captivating charm of Lausanne. This lakeside quarter is a particularly popular meeting place in summer. Stroll along the spacious quays through magnificent gardens, via the Place de la Navigation with its pools, past the Château d’Ouchy to the harbour.
Olympic Capital
The six rings of the Olympic Games and the Olympic flame are part of Lausanne’s DNA. Wander through the Olympic Park with its sculptures and sports facilities. Encounter the exhilarating history of the Games and cheer along with the athletes in the interactive museum. Another highlight: the bold curves of the IOC headquarters next to the historic Château de Vidy. 
Around Lausanne
Enjoy a tour of the terraced vineyards of Lavaux, with the famous wine villages of Epesses and St-Saphorin. Take a detour to Montreux and nearby Chillon Castle. Alternatively, enjoy the view of the surroundings of Lausanne and the wine terraces by boat.
Experience Lausanne for less
The Lausanne Transport Card lets you travel for free on public transport in the Lavaux area and enjoy discounted leisure activities. The Lausanne City Pass combines free public transport with free or discounted admission to many activities.
