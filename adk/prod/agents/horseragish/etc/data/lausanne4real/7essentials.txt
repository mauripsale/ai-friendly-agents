7 essential things to see in Lausanne

7 essential things to see in Lausanne
The Lausanner
The Lausanner
Hereâ€™s a glimpse of Lausanneâ€™s 7 must-sees that will make you forget everything else during a weekend in the lakeside town.

1. Lausanne Cathedral
You canâ€™t miss it! Lausanne Cathedral is undoubtedly a must-see attraction of the Vaud capital. An essential port of call for any visitor. Renowned as one of most beautiful gothic art monuments in Europe, the Cathedral offers a splendid view over the whole town, Lake Geneva and the Alps. The 224 steps that separate you from the top of the belfry will be quickly forgotten as you contemplate the breathtaking landscape! ðŸ˜‰ Thatâ€™s it then, we put the Cathedral as number 1 on our to-do list and pack a pair of sturdy shoes (not forgetting a camera).


2. The Olympic Museum and the history of the Olympic Games
Lausanne is also a cultural hotspot with its many internationally renowned museums, such as the Fondation de lâ€™Hermitage (fine art) or the Art Brut Museum. Among that long list, the Olympic Museum remains an absolute must for lovers of sport. An interactive museum that takes you on a journey through the history of the Olympic Games and thatâ€™s sure to appeal to children and adults alike! (After all, thereâ€™s no age limit for having fun ðŸ™‚ )





3. Ouchy and its lakeside walk
For a walk, a siesta in a park or just to admire the view on Lake Geneva and the mountains, head to Ouchy. It only takes a teensy ray of sunshine for the lakeside walkways to be packed with joggers, cyclists, people rollerblading and strolling. Youâ€™ve just got to stop and treat yourself to an ice-cream before chilling in the sun. And with a spectacular view to boot! ðŸ˜‰





4. Lavaux vineyards
A UNESCO World Heritage site that is a must-see during any stay in Lausanne, Lavaux seems to be unaffected by the passing of time. Terraced vineyards with Lake Geneva and the Alps as a backdrop, the beauty of this landscape canâ€™t fail to move you. Itâ€™s a unique area where Lausanners love to go for walks on steep paths. The cherry on the cake is that you can end it with an authentic wine tasting in one of the local winegrowerâ€™s cellars ðŸ˜‰


5. Plateforme 10
Plateforme 10 is the art district, which brings together the Cantonal Museum of Fine Arts (MCBA), the Museum of Design and Contemporary Applied Arts (mudac) and the well known Photo ElysÃ©e. While visiting this essential place in Lausanne, you will feed your mindâ€¦ but not only! The delicious restaurants of the museum, the Nabi, the Lumen cafÃ© and the Arcadia, are there to satisfy your belly after your visit.

6. Lake Geneva
Lake Geneva is the gem that makes Lausanne sparkle and its heart beat. From an esplanade, an unexpected opening between buildings, on a terrace, the largest freshwater lake in Europe can be seen from a great many viewpoints in Lausanne. Just about everything lures you down to its shores: chilling on one of the small beaches along the waterfront, a short cruise on one of the Compagnie GÃ©nÃ©rale de Navigationâ€™s famous steamboats, wakeboard and stand-up paddle boarding for the more athletic, an outing on a paddle boat in Ouchy or a dip in the lake in Vidy for those who enjoy more sedate activitiesâ€¦ The lake is well and truly part of the Lausanne lifestyle.



7. Points of view
Built on three hills, Lausanne is a very steep town. So much so that film director Godart used to say of Lausanne ladies that the constant uphill walking gave them the nicest legs in the world. ðŸ˜‰

This unusual topography offers incredible points of view: from the top of the Cathedralâ€™s belfry, Sauvabelin Tower, Montbenon Esplanade or the Flon esplanadeâ€¦
