First visit - excellent
Excellent Museum and learnt a lot. Well laid out with very good descriptions of the exhibits. Clean and great facilities. Nice gardens too with wonderful views of the Lake.

A looming figure in old town, we enjoyed a stop here. Beautiful architecture, more plain that many cathedrals we’ve seen in other European cities but a real nice place to visit and take a break

Lausanne ,a Must !
Lausanne is worth visiting from all points of view, which points of view are countless.I will mention only some, such as fantasticly friendly urban environment, beautiful land/lake/hill scapes !!! The locals are polite and friendly. Not to mention the highlits! One of them is the Art Museum Brut ! Unique! Google to find out what this is!
As about the supermarket prices, equal and in some cases even lower than in Greece. I mean Lidl.

Treasure trove of terrific art
For over an hour we were lost in admiration with superb art.

Many of the Western paintings are courtesy of Edouard Vuillard, and fabulous they are too. A prolific artist who died in 1940 his oeuvre on display covered domestic, sea, beach and landscapes scenes.

Cogently being influenced by Japanese prints provided for an exhibition junxtapositioning of the above mentioned next to Vuillard works. Some beautiful of the former include pieces by the masters Utagawa Hiroshige and Utagawa Kunisada.

Other artists here include Felix Vallotton whose La Grève Blanche is captivating and thought provoking. A sombre artwork it shows a beach upon which are walking two tiny human figures. Powerfully signifying the relative insignificance of humans amongst majestic nature.

In the heart of the Old Town, there is a small craft market on Fridays. Shops, cafes, chocolate. Walk. Stop. Have a coffee. Nice, yes. Terrific, no.

There will never be another one like it.
Rolex Learning Center is a multi-function student center on the EPFL campus. A design competition led to the swoopy, gravity defying one-story building designed by Japan-based firm SANAA. While it’s highly photogenic, it’s not very functional and many changes have been made to accommodate student needs and safety concerns.
A better iteration on this flowing concrete design motif can be found on Teshima Island, Japan in an art project - also by SANAA.
If you visit the EPFL campus, you owe it to yourself to stop by and take a look. You’ll not see anything else like it this side of Japan.

Nice, but HUGE JUMPSCARE
It was really nice, lots of fish and terrarium. It was really clean and looked as if you were in there. But after the tunnel, there is a HUGE replica of an aquatic dinosaur, that MOVES (only its gigantic head), and it scared the living daylights out of me. As a person with autism, I did not apreciate that, and would have liked a warning. Therefore, I am writing a review.

Nice Way Down from the Cathedral.
In the Old Town, the upper entrance is by the Cathedral. Walk down (not a long set of steps) and see shops, reaching one of the squares. Nice stroll.

Delightful overlooking the Lake
It’s not solely the presence of the outstanding Museum here, it is fabulous in its own right. Overlooking the beautiful Lake it is an expansive sylvan area.

It was lovely strolling the pathways, relaxing and enjoying the vistas all around.

Many sculptures are throughout, many with an Olympics theme. Including a bronze copy of Diadumenos, first created by the Greek Polyclitus in 420 BCE.

Free entrance to cantonal museum !
Overall our visit to this museum has been a nice experience. The entrance is free but we booked our tickets online for the day of our visit. The building is huge and it develops on 2 floors: on each floor there is a permanent exhibition and a temporary one. There are mainly paintings from Swiss artists so not very well known. However it has been a good experience to learn more about Swiss artists ! It is also opened on Sunday so strongly suggested for a winter/autumn Sunday afternoon.
