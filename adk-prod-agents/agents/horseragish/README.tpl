## Pre-requisites

Install `uv` and `just` (+ `glow` for the readme CLI integration)

On Mac OS, you can use Homebrew:

```bash
brew install just uv glow
```

## Running the agents

Use `just`:

```
{{ just_l_output }}
```


## Nice to have

- `glow`: nice and colorful. [website](https://github.com/charmbracelet/glow)
- `git-privatize`: from the insane mind of Ricc: [git-privatize](https://github.com/palladius/sakura/blob/master/bin/git-privatize)

## Thanks

I'd like to thank Max H for the technical help and the inspiration to create this agent.
