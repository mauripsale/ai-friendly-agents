[user]: whats the Allowed directory?
[enterprise_assistant]: The allowed directory is: `/usr/local/google/home/ricc/git/ai-friendly-agents/adk-prod-agents/agents/filomena`

[user]: create a GEMINI.md file describing whats in thid folder
[enterprise_assistant]: I can create a `GEMINI.md` file, but I need to know what to write in it. Could you please describe what's in the folder `/usr/local/google/home/ricc/git/ai-friendly-agents/adk-prod-agents/agents/filomena` so I can create the file?

[user]: add a list of the current directory `ls -al` basically inside the MD.
[enterprise_assistant]: Okay, I will create a `GEMINI.md` file and add a list of the current directory content inside it. To do this, I first need to list the directory content and then write it to the file.

[enterprise_assistant]: Now that I have the directory listing, I will create the `GEMINI.md` file with the listing inside.

[enterprise_assistant]: I have created the `GEMINI.md` file in the directory `/usr/local/google/home/ricc/git/ai-friendly-agents/adk-prod-agents/agents/filomena` and added the directory listing to it.

[user]: wow, amazing.
```

See result in `GEMINI.md`, hereby checked in.
