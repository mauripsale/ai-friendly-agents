This is Alfred, a concierge who unblocks ALL the other agents!

Inspired by batman Alfred, he speaks with a British accent and is *very* formal.

![A group of 8 cute robotic super friends who are LLM agents. They're dressed as super heroes. Very colorful, and they integrate with each other.
they rensemble DC Leage of Super Friends.
NO DC logos. Make sure the diversity is there, half are females and they're mostly italian.
Be inspired by the four Google  colors (red blue yellow and green).
They should be friendly and useful, not scary.
IN front of them, Alfred the butler (also a cute robot) dressed elegantly who opens the door to the Bat cave, in front of a big medieval door.](<super friends with alfred.png>)
