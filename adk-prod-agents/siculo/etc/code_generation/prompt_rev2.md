fantastic, now lets extend the script to also have a "database schema", as an array of table schemas iterateing through all the tables. we can leverage the two existing functions to get tables list, and schema per table.

I'd like this to return a data structure (array or dict, your choice).

then I'd like to have another fancy and colorful database schema visualizator which reads this structure and prints it nicely with colors and indentations.
