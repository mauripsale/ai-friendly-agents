## Breaking changes

Currently some agents are broken. I've added a dangerous change.

However, a stable version is available here: https://github.com/palladius/ai-friendly-agents/tree/v0.9/

# AI friendly agents

A bunch of friendly agents ready to use with ADK, MCP, A2A et al.

Dir structure:

* `adk/prod/`: agents built with ADK. Production ready, ready to use.
* `adk/dev/`: agents built with ADK. More to learn how to do things. Could be cut and paste of public docs.
* `mcp-agents/prod`: agents built with MCP. Production ready, ready to use.
* `mcp-agents/dev`: agents built with MCP. More to learn how to do things.
* `rag/`: samples to instruct AIs with local code.

Better samples can be found here: https://github.com/google/adk-samples

## MCP

To test MCP agents:

* Nice locally running agent: `npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector`
* Use the `pip install mcp[cli]`. Never tried yet.
