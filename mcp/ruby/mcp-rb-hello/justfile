# Install dependencies using Gemfile.builder.

# We're explicitly telling Bundler to use 'Gemfile.builder'.
# Usage: just install
install:

# Run the application server.
# This recipe depends on 'install' to ensure dependencies are met before running.
# Usage: just run-server

    # ðŸŸ¡ IMPORTANT: You might need to change 'ruby main.rb' below!
    # This is a placeholder. Check how your 'mcp-rb' application is meant to be started.
    # It could be 'ruby app.rb', 'rackup', or a specific command from the 'mcp-rb' gem.
    # BUNDLE_GEMFILE={{justfile_directory()}}/Gemfile.builder bundle exec ruby main.rb
    bundle exec ruby hello-mcp-server.rb



# rake test - only works on the gem, not here.
